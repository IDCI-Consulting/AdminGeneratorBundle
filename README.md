Generate CRUD backoffice
========================

A CRUD interface, already stylized with bootstrap, can be easily generated with this command.

    php app/console doctrine:generate:crud:twitter-bootstrap

Then you have to:

   * Indicate for which entity you want to generate a CRUD.
   Exemple : IdciMyBundle:Entity
   * Indicate weather or not you want to generate "write actions" such as "new, update and delete"
   * Determine the format to use (annotation, yml, php, xml)
   * Determine the route prefix

Before anything else, you should download the bootstrap archive at http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/assets/bootstrap.zip.
Then extract it into your /web directory which is at the root of the project.

Your CRUD entity is generated, as well as the layout.
